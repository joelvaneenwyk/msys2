# MSYS2 Windows Container

Setup scripts for a MSYS2 environment on Windows. This was born out of development work done for a GNU project ([Stow - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)) and repeatedly running into issues with host environment changing and impacting testing. Total install of an MSYS2 environment for GNU development with documentation creation tools (e.g., tex, texlive, etc), it is over 3GB but with a considerable build time. This Docker image is meant to solve that by providing a reliable environment for testing that changes very little.
